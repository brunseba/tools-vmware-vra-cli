## Overview

The VMware vRA CLI is a comprehensive command-line interface tool designed to interact with VMware vRealize Automation environments. It provides a rich set of commands for managing service catalogs, deployments, workflows, and system configuration through a secure, authenticated API layer.

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns with distinct modules for authentication, API clients, CLI commands, and configuration management
2. **Security First**: Secure credential storage, token management, and SSL/TLS communication
3. **Extensibility**: Plugin-based architecture allowing for easy addition of new commands and features
4. **User Experience**: Rich terminal output, multiple output formats, and comprehensive error handling
5. **Cross-Platform**: Compatible across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **CLI Framework**: Click
- **HTTP Client**: Requests with retry mechanisms
- **Authentication**: Custom VMware vRA authentication flow
- **Configuration**: JSON-based persistent configuration
- **Security**: System keyring integration
- **Documentation**: MkDocs with Material theme
- **Testing**: pytest with comprehensive test coverage
- **Packaging**: Python wheels with automated CI/CD
